How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
So that we can commit ech section separately
and also compare.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add a single file and then commit. Then add the other sections and commit.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches help when we are working on a completely different feature and we would like to keep a tab on our changes without modifying the stable code.
